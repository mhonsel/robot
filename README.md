This repository contains code for a small, self-driving robot with computer vision-based object tracking. The project is in progress and not yet ready for general use or application.

Project Overview

The robot utilizes PID-controlled differential drive, a pan-tilt camera system, and deep learning-based object detection to recognize and follow specific targets. It integrates Raspberry Pi GPIO motor control, TensorFlow Lite models for edge AI, and real-time image processing.

Note

This repository is primarily for personal development and safekeeping. While the code is available, it is not in a final state and may require significant modifications before use in other projects.
